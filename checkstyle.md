I am the original developer of the [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) tool ([Github](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle)). If you are a Java developer, you will now either love or hate me!

After more than ten years leading the development, I stepped down from that role, and took on the role of an interested observer.

This website still hosts the DTD files that are referenced by the Checkstyle configuration files.

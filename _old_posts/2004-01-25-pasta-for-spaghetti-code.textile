I have mentioned <a href="../fight_evil_with_metrics_plug/">before</a> that I think circular dependencies are evil and should be avoided, especially between packages. In fact, I had this very discussion the other day at work.</p>

<p>
What started this conversation was that I have started analysing our source code with a nifty new tool called <a href="http://javacentral.compuware.com/pasta/">Pasta</a> from Compuware which is a Package Structure Analysis Tool. It takes a little getting used to but is excellent.

<p>
It sure beats <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend</a> for ease of use, and unfortunately <a href="http://metrics.sf.net">Metrics</a> does not work with Eclipse 3.0 M6.

I just came across  a great quote <a href="http://freeroller.net/page/rsaunders/20040116#the_best_quote">from here</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
Programming can be an art, but in a corporate environment, it's just a means to an end. If Tool Boy wants to practice his art, maybe he should get a university job?
</blockquote>

<p>
This quote stirs up many emotions and thoughts. I now work in an environment of fixed price bids and dealing with non-technical people. As much as I might not want to admit it, this quote is right on the money. My friend <a href="http://freeroller.net/page/bcarney">Bruce</a> will be saying - <i>I told you so! :-)</i>

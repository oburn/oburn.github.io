title: Unit testing is a waste of time?
category: Java
---
<p>I am sick of being asked over the years by management whether is it
is worth putting the effort into unit testing. There are lots of
studies that show how beneficial unit testing is, especially for large
projects like my current one which will last a couple of years and have
50+ programmers involved.</p>
<p>So, does anybody out there know of any studies that show that
unit test is a waste of time?</p>
<p>Personally I think you are insane not to.</p>

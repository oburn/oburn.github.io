<p>
  Well the Checkstyle team has
  finally <a href="http://tinyurl.com/88zqp">released version 4.0</a>. It was a very long beta cycle, in part due to the complexity
  of Java 5, but also due to the committers being
  busy <a href="http://hi5.ninemsn.com.au/">with</a> <a href="http://www.thewiggles.com/">life</a>.
</p>

<p>
  So far the release has been broadcast in a few places. The plan is to
  verify that there are no show stopper issues before announcing the
  release more widely. People tend to be shy of beta releases and often
  when a new release comes out, all of a sudden bugs are identified.

  I very much
  doubt <a href="http://jayfields.blogspot.com/2005/11/whats-in-your-build.html#113321517110738579">this loser</a> (having a Hani moment:-) will be trying out the latest
  release. This has to rate as one of the stupidest reasons I have ever
  heard for not using a tool like Checkstyle. John even talked about it
  some more
  in <a href="http://software-nomad.blogspot.com/2005/08/magic-numbers.html">his blog</a>. Do not blame Checkstyle if people write stupid code to
  bypass it. After all is just an aid to help write good code, not a
  guarantee.

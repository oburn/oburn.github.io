      Over the weekend I spent some time looking at the books that I
      have collected in my professional library. It is clear that <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/">Steve McConnell</a> is one
      of my favourite authors and I have almost all of his <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/books.htm">books</a>. One of
      my all time favourite books being the <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/sg.htm">Software Project Survival Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project I am working is in the early stages of a significant
      development effort and there are lots of discussions between
      development and project management over the schedule. When reading
      the related sections in <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rd.htm">Rapid Development</a>
      it struck me how as a supposedly professional profession, we do
      not learn from previous mistakes and continue to break fundamental
      rules of development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I reflected on this at work in a conversation with a colleague. As
      an example I talked about the <i>Triangle of truth</i>, which is
      my name for what Steve McConnell talks about as the trade off
      between schedule, cost and product (page 126 of <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rd.htm">Rapid Development</a>). Basically all three should be kept in balance
      and no single role on a project can own all three.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wish as a profession we could learn fundamental rules like
      this. So when a project manager comes and demands that <i>"You
      must deliver function X in one month with two programmers"</i>, we
      can say <i>"OK, but the quality will be very poor as there is not
      enough time to do a quality job"</i> (unless of course there is
      enough time:-).

<p>You know how some people do things that make you nervous. Things like insisting on looking at you while driving the car and talking.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/bcarney">BMC</a> for many years, and he never stopped making me nervous with his cowboy approach to system administration. He would happily mess with the DLL's in his Windows directory or randomly edit the registry. Not a bad thing if you know what you are doing (he did not despite his claims).</p>

<p>Now he has <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/bcarney/20050426#dll_cruising">posted</a> that he had found a great site for sourcing OCX files.</p>

<p>So yes BMC, I am screaming, I am screaming <i>You are not touching my machine!</i>. :-)</p>

This is the personal website and blog for Oliver Burn. I am a big believer in the *"do the simplest thing that can possibly work"* principle, and have applied it to this web site!

The website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted (for free)
 using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
 
If you are wondering why the site is called `puppycrawl.com`, you are not alone. The source of inspiration for the name came from a dog named "[Applet](/images/applet.gif)".
 
# Open Source
I ~~am~~ was an active participant on the Open Source community. I am probably best known (hated?) for developing the tool [Checkstyle](/checkstyle/). It is a  development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard.

# Professional
During the day I work at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) as an Architect from Sydney, Australia.

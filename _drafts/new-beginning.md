This is a new take on my personal blog and website. I have consolidated both to a single static website that is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted by GitHub. I may eventually copy [Madbean](http://madbean.com) and relocate my site to Amazon S3.

My old blog content has been migrated from JRoller. The old blog site will remain for historical reasons, but all new blog posts will appear on this website.

Just when you think you know Java..... <a href="http://codefeed.com/blog/">Conor</a> goes and writes an <a href="http://codefeed.com/blog/archives/000077.html">excellent blog</a> about object construction and virtual methods in Java, C\# and C**. Funny that Java comes off looking bad (IMHO).

Nice blog Conor, I bet you made <a href="http://madbean.com/blog/">Matt</a> jealous with this one. :-)

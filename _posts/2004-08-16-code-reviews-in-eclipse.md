<p>
Reading <a href="http://youarenumber6.blogspot.com/2004/08/how-to-set-world-record-for-code.html">this nice blog</a>, I have learnt about an interesting code review plug-in for Eclipse called <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Jupiter/">Jupiter</a>. Having installed and <i>kicked the tyres</i>, I can give it the official <a href="http://jroller.com/page/bcarney">BMC</a> double thumbs up!

<p>
The only issue I have is that it is based on Eclipse and most of the developers where I currently work use <a href="http://www.intellij.com/idea/">IDEA</a>. I am after a tool for performing electronic code reviews and not resorting to printing out the code on paper. The only other open source tool I have found for code reviews is <a href="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/">Codestriker</a>. Be interested in hearing about any others.

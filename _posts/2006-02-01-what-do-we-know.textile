    <p>
      I really enjoyed listening to the podcast <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail787.html">What 
      Do We Know</a> by Robert Trivers. To quote....
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The capacity of humans to deceive each other is well documented by 
      history and personal experience. Less well known, however, is the 
      capacity of most living things to deceive each other - species deceiving 
      other species, members of their own species and themselves. We are, it 
      seems, not that different from parasites, insects and bacteria in this 
      regard.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Dr. Robert Trivers talks about the evolutionary basis of deception in 
      this address from Pop!Tech 2005. The first half of this talk focusses on 
      the biological examples of deception in the natural world, with 
      explanations for the evolutionary advantages of deception and 
      self-deception.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Later in the talk, Dr. Trivers supplies easily recognizable examples of 
      common human self-deception. He then delves into an overtly political 
      criticism of human deception and self-deception, with an emphasis on 
      current events.

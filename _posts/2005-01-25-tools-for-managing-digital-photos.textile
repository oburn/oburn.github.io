title: Tools for managing digital photos
category: Java

<P>I recently have been producing a physical photo album from the
2,500 digital images I have. I used a number of tools in the process,
so I thought I would blog about them.</P>

					<P>Nice image management tool. I like it because it is fast to
					use, is file based, and supports image manipulation like red-eye
					reduction etc.</P>

				<TD WIDTH=80% VALIGN=TOP>
					<P>Used for cropping photos to 4&rdquo;x6&rdquo; for printing as
					the aspect ratio of the original photos does not match the print
					format. Has a quick UI for cropping a lot of photos.</P>

					<P>Python script that supports renaming image files to the date
					the image was created as recorded in the EXIF header. Useful to
					quickly create a time line for a set of photos.</P>

					<P>Creates a web album for a set of files. Useful for sharing
					online. Nice to see a mainstream tool written in Java.</P>

<P>I did try using the latest Google offering <A HREF="http://www.picasa.com/index.php">Picasa
2</A>. I ended up not liking it as:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It is not file based &ndash; it seems (to me) to actively
	avoid showing a folder-view of your photos. Big deal for me as I
	manage photos in folders based on date.</P>
	<LI><P>Modifications to an image is are not stored immediately in
	the file. Instead you need to export your changes.</P>
	<LI><P>Not efficient to perform batch cropping.</P>
</UL>

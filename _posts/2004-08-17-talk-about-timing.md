Just saw <a href="http://timshadel.com/blog/2004/08/16/1092701249000.html">this blog</a> which is also raving about <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Jupiter/">Jupiter</a>. I must admit that in testing Jupiter I reviewed some code I have written recently. It is a very neat way of recording personal notes.

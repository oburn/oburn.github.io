<p>
Well after about three months of work, it is time to have a beer to celebrate the release of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=161615">version 3.1</a> of <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a>. There are many <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html">new features</a> in this release.

</p>
<p>
A focus of this release has been adding more design oriented checks, my favourite being the check to detect use of the broken <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_coding.html#DoubleCheckedLocking">"double-checked locking"</a> idiom.

</p>
<p>
One of the nice things about being involved in open source development is interacting with developers around the world. We now have committers from the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany and Russia..

I use <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> as my RSS reader as it is a webapp that I can access from any of the machines I use, whether at work or at home. The interface is very nice to!

</p>
<p>
One of the nifty features of Bloglines is the ability to setup a feed that contains the results of searching all the RSS feeds that Bloglines pulls in (this is a lot). I use it to search for postings about things that interest me, like <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a>.

Today I came across a <a href="http://www.jobserve.com/W2B90D03E63708DAA.job">job advertisement</a> that details that development is done with <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a>. I hope that they do not use it as a <a href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/blogs/simon/archives/000198.html">blunt instrument</a>!. Either way, the advertisement is sure to polarise opinions in the people reading it. :-)

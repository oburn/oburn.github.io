  One of the nice things about buying electrical equipment from <a href="http://www.dse.com.au">Dick Smith</a> is that they have a 14-day
  no questions asked refund policy. Today I took advantage of it to
  return a <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/pdas/pdas/0,239035588,240057263,00.htm">iPAC
  rx1950</a> that I bought four days ago. When asked why I was returning
  it, I said <i>it was not as good as my Palm</i> and I got my refund of
  $348.
</p>

<p>
  I have been using Palm devices actively since 1997. So what motivated
  me to upgrade to the iPAC from a <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/support/tungstene/">Palm Tungsten E</a>. Well, here were the reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wi-Fi access.</li>
  <li>Ability to play WMV videos.</li>
  <li>Better screen.</li>
  <li>
    Try something new as the Palm platform is pretty much dead as far as
    I can tell.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So why did I go back to what is a dead platform by my own words. Here
  is what is wrong with the iPAQ:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The battery life of the iPAC was horrendous. I played with it for
    about 30 minutes last night testing the Wi-Fi access and the battery
    dropped from fully charged to 75%. I then left the device connected
    to the USB cable overnight and it dropped to 50%.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compounding the first point, recharging the device is a pain. It
    clearly does not trickle charge from the USB cable on my laptop
    meaning that I would need to plug it into the AC adapter. This is
    unacceptable as my laptop is in the lounge room and my SO would kill
    me if I had more cables lying around. Further, with my Palm I just
    leave it plugged in at home or at work and the trickle charge keeps
    it fully powered. I have not used to AC adaptor in two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Wi-Fi access works, but as a form factor the iPAQ sucks (as
    would a Palm). Reading Gmail was achievable, but not an enjoyable
    process. Given the battery life, it was clearly not something I was
    going to do often.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.avantgo.com">AvantGo</a> is something I use all
    the time on the Palm to read the paper on the train. To synchronise
    on the iPAQ you have to launch the AvantGo client on device and
    manually synchronise. On the Palm, AvantGo is synchronised when you
    synch the device. This extra step was going to drive me nuts over
    time.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have used <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/palm/">Eat
    Watch</a> since 1999, so yes I have seven years of data. A port of
    this program does not exist for the iPAQ and I was not going to
    write one. Yes, I could use Excel to collect the data for input into
    a desktop clone of Eat Watch I wrote for my parents, but what a
    hassle.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form factor. The Palm is nice and slim with an integrated cover that
    fits easily into my pocket.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So I am back to my Palm, which I can still use for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking weight in Eat Watch.</li>
  <li>Reading the paper in AvantGo.</li>
  <li>Listening to MP3s.</li>
  <li>Synchronising with Outlook.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When the Palm dies I will need to consider whether I stick with the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-e2/">dead platform</a> or go for the next generation iPAQ.

<p>
I am happy to say that <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle 4.4</a> has
been released. Certainly a long time between releases! See <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html">here</a>
for details.
</p>

<p>
I have been on my current (work) project for well over three
years. Whilst I have learnt a lot of things, Java 5 has not been
one of them. I have done a few pet projects in it, but nothing
serious. Hence I have convinced the Checkstyle team to branch
Checkstyle and work on a version 5.x.
</p>

<p>
This version is based on Java 5 source, will require Java 5 JRE,
and is geared towards supporting Java 5 better. The current state
is available from the Subversion repository. A new
GenericWhitespace check has been written to properly the Generic
type tokens '<' and '>'. This will be a huge relief for anybody
who has tried to apply Checkstyle to a Java 5 source code base.

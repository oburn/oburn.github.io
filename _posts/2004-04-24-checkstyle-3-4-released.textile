<p>
  I have been slack recently.  Yesterday I got an e-mail from <a
  href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/blogs/simon/">Simon</a> who
  was unaware that release 3.4 of <a
  href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a> had been
  released. Simon is the author of the excellent copy/paste detector
  called <a
  href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/">Simian</a>.
  Checkstyle is apparently a <a
  href="http://jroller.com/page/scotartt/20040419#ant_1_6_1_import">much
  feared</a> development tool for helping (read forcing! :-) programmers
  write Java code that adheres to a coding standard.
</p>

<p>
  Release 3.4 can be downloaded from the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29721">SourceForge
  download page</a>. A significant number of <a
  href="http://checkstyle.sf.net/releasenotes.html">fixes and
  features</a> have been added in this release. In particular more
  metrics related checks contributed by Simon. I just love <i>Metric
  Driven Development &copy;</i>. :-)

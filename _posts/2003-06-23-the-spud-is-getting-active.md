<p>
It is great to see that <a href="http://madbean.com/blog/">Spud</a> (a.k.a Matt Quail) is starting to get involved in open-source development, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=757846&group_id=29721&atid=397080">including Checkstyle</a>. Matt is easily one of best developers I have ever come across in my career. So good in fact, <a href="http://madbean.com/blog/20/">he claims</a> to have read the "Java in a Nutshell&quot; book the night before I interviewed him as a graduate. To this day, he was one of the best Java programmers I interviewed.

</p>
<p>
The real irony is that when Matt started work, I got him to develop the predecessor to Checkstyle that used <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a>. Over the course of a few weeks, involving extensive reviews, Matt produced a great little application that ended being used by our <a href="http://www.research.avayalabs.com/COMapY.html#local">sponsor company site</a>. His reward was to then spend a couple of weeks fixing all the errors the tool found in the software the team had written over the last six months (this included Javadoc:-).

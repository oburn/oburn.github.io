This is a new take on my personal blog and website. I have consolidated both to a single static website that is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted by GitHub. I may eventually copy [Madbean](http://madbean.com) and relocate my site to Amazon S3.

My old blog content has been migrated from [JRoller][jroller]. The old blog site will remain for historical reasons, but all new blog posts will appear on this website.

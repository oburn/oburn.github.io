<p>
Being the kind of person I am, I wanted a quick easy way to publish to my blog. I found that the <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/userguide/roller-ug.html">Roller user guide</a> mentioned the <a href="http://wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a> client. It looked ideal, except I could not get it to work using the suggested <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/userguide/bloggar.jpg">settings</a>.

</p>
<p>
Being rather frustrated, I dug around for a bit trying to find the solution. Good old <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> got me part of the answer from <a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/nicolaken/20030201">here</a>. The only missing part of the link was to use port 80, not 8080 as the user guide suggested.

</p>

So the final settings that work are:

<div align="center">

</div>

<p>
The Checkstyle team has made available a version 4.0 beta 1 available for use. You can get it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29721">download page</a>. This release introduces preliminary support (beta quality) for the Java 5 language. Previous versions of Java are still supported so this release should be a drop in replacement for the 3.5 release.

</p>
<p>
The reason for the beta release is to solicit feedback on the Java 5 support, a lot of which was provided by <a href="http://www.michaelstudman.com/codegargle/index.do">Michael</a> (thanks!).

</p>
<p>
Other new features and bug fixes are documented at <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html">here</a>.

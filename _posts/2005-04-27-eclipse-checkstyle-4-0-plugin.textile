  I <a

  that</a> Rich Hightower has been complaining that the Eclipse plug-in
  does not support the Checkstyle 4.0 beta release. This is actually not
  the case, the developers of the <a
  href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/">Eclipse Checkstyle
  Plug-in</a> have an alpha release available for <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80344">download</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The latest release now supports the using the standard Checkstyle
  configuration files. This is a great advance as it makes it easier to
  share configurations between Eclipse and ANT.

<p>I just read <a href="http://jroller.com/page/scotartt/20040329#eclipse_m8_team_synchronisation_colour">Scot's blog</a> about Eclipse M8. I had very big laugh as he mentioned that I hated his choice of Lime Green.</p>

<p>This is very funny as in a past life I used to get a huge ribbing from my work mates because I used to feature Lime Green heavily in any web site prototype I developed. Funny how things change! :-)</p>

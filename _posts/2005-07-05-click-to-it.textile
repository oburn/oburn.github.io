<p>It is great to see that my friend Malcolm has been busy
improving his <a href="http://click.sourceforge.net/">Click framework</a> and has released <a  href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/click/click-0.6.zip?download">version 0.6</a>. I have had many lunchtime conversations with Malcolm
over the years talking about what is good/bad about Struts and
Tapestry, and he is definitely knowledgeable in both. There is a nice
write up on "<a href="http://click.sourceforge.net/docs/why-click.html">Why Click</a>".</p>
<p>To quote from the website, Click is a J2EE web application
framework created for commercial Java developers and features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very easy to learn</li>
  <li>Component and Page Oriented design</li>
  <li>Event base programming model</li>
  <li>Automatic form validation</li>
  <li>Page templating</li>
  <li>Velocity page rendering</li>
  <li>Superb error reporting</li>
  <li>High performance</li>
</ul>

title: From JBoss Rules to brainf*ck
category: Java

<p>I have been reading up on <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossrules/">JBoss Rules</a> (used to be Drools) and got interested in refreshing my memory on what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing Complete</a> meant. Ended up reading about a classic language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfuck</a>. It really is funny and did my head in for a while while I deciphered the classic <i>Hello World!</i> example. I would not like to do serious programming in that language.</p>

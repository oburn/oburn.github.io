Well enough is enough, so I have decided to switch from Twitter to Mastodon. Why? I will let you decide.

I have followed [this advice](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/use-your-own-user-domain-for-mastodon-discoverability-with-the-webfinger-protocol-without-hosting-a-server) and created the immutable Mastodon handle `@oliver@puppycrawl.com`,  backed by [this file](https://puppycrawl.com/.well-known/webfinger), which you can search for on any Mastodon instance, and it will redirect you to whereever I decide to host my identity. Currently this is at <https://theblower.au/@oliver> - which I chip in $2/month to keep going.

I have not deleted my Twitter account, so I can keep my handle if Twitter ever comes back to being reasonable again. But, I have deleted all my remaining tweets. Note, I have been using [TweetDelete](https://tweetdelete.net/) for a long time, I never had tweets older than 3 months anyway.

<p>
I have recently read a couple of Blogs that have resonated with me. The first is by Martin Fowler about the pattern <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SunkCostDrivenArchitecture.html">SunkCostDrivenArchitecture</a>. I wish I could have every dollar I have personally seen wasted on this pattern - I could retire tomorrow! :-)

The second is by a self confessed Swinger, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/swinger/20040608#there_we_go">Antonio Vieiro</a>. He has written a blog about <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/swinger/20040614#overdoing_things">OverPatterning, OverJ2EEing, OverUMLing</a>. He has summed up some of my recent thoughts perfectly.

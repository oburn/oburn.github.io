title: A tenuous argument, but....
category: Java

<p>
I just read Matt's very good blog about Java becoming a <a href="http://madbean.com/blog/20/">Language For Smart People</a>, which sparked a very good comment that <a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/ceperez/20030603#java_is_a_language_for">Java Is a Language for the Masses</a>. It got Malcolm Edgar and I thinking that for something to be popular, and hence successful, it must be simple. For example, the must popular blog I have seen is <a href="http://www.wibsite.com/wiblog/dull/">The dullest blog in the world</a>.
</p>

<p>
The corollary of all this is, smart people like complex things which are unpopular and hence, unsuccessful.

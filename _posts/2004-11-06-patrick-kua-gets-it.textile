<p>I just read <a href="http://www.thekua.com/rant">Patrick Kua</a>'s excellent <a href="http://www.thekua.com/rant/index.php?p=47">blog</a> about how to setup Checkstyle with a custom Check to ensure that sessions are properly closed within method scopes. It really nice when somebody you have never met, gets how to use Checkstyle properly.</p>

<p>On my current project, one person wrote a custom Check to ensure that all caught exceptions were either were properly logged or were wrapped and re-thrown. This helped address the problem where we were losing valuable debugging information.</p>

Thanks to <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/1/12/239016.html">this blog</a> I found a reference to the great essay <a href="http://renaud.waldura.com/doc/java/final-keyword.shtml">The Final Word on the final Keyword</a> by Renaud Waldura. Anybody who has ever worked with me knows that I am equally mad about the <code>final</code> keyword. Renaud has put together a great analysis of why it is good to be mad about it.

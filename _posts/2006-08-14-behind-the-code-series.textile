  I really enjoy the Microsoft <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Behind_The_Code">Behind The Code</a> series. I find it is both informative and interesting. The latest episode is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=224935#224935">Tony Williams: Co-inventor of COM</a>, which is well worth watching.

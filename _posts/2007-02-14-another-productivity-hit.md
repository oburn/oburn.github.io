<p>
I remember a long time ago talking to another open source developer about finding the time to work on projects. He commented that the biggest impact on the productivity of open source developers were wives, girlfriends and children. He was certainly right. I am pleased to say that my own personal productivity has taken another hit as I got married recently on the 3rd of February. Also my nine month old baby and 5 year old certainly a nice diversion.

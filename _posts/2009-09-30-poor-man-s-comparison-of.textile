title: Poor man's comparison of AV products

<p class="first">This is a limited, non-scientific comparison of AntiVirus products for
Windows XP. I did the testing on an old machine running Windows XP SP3
with 512MB RAM.</p>

<p>The four AntiVirus options I compared were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">avast! Home Edition</a> - free for home use</li>

<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> - free for home use</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sunbeltsoftware.com/Home-Home-Office/VIPRE/">VIPRE Antivirus + Antispyware</a> - reasonably priced</li>
<li>Nothing - that is right, no protection at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>The things I compared were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of memory being consumed after booting the machine. This
is a rough indicator of how much memory is consumed by the AV
software.</li>

<li>The time to launch Portable Apps version of OpenOffice Calc for the
first time. This is a <em>cold launch</em>. I used OpenOffice as it a
notoriously slow application.</li>
<li>The time to launch OpenOffice Calc for the second time. This is a
<em>warm launch</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following graph shows the results for memory consumption:</p>

<p>The following graph shows the results for launch times:</p>

<p>I will let you draw your conclusions from the results above. Personally,
I will be sticking with <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">avast! Home Edition</a> that I have been using for a
while now.</p>

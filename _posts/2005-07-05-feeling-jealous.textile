<p>Some blog entries like <a href="http://madbean.com/2005/calamari-safari/">this one</a>
make you feel very jealous. How many people can claim to have gone to
JavaOne and while there been taken out to dinner by <a href="http://today.java.net/jag/">James Gosling</a>
the father of Java. The fact that the food was great just adds to the
jealousy. :-)</p>

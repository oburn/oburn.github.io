This week I decided to start running my work computer without using a swap file. I wish I had done it ages ago as my machine is so much more responsive. No longer do I have to wait while Windoze swaps out one application for another. Why oh why do they use the swap file when there is real RAM still available.

For the curious, I have 1Gb of RAM on my PC which is amble for what I do. Contrary to what <a href="http://jroller.com/page/bcarney">some people</a> think, I still do some Java development.

<b>Update 04-Nov-2004:</b> Found a good article on turning off your swap at the <a href="http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/news/roundup045.shtml">Java Performance Tuning</a> website. Find the <i>PMS</i> term interesting.......

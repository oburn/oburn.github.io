I really enjoyed watching the video <a href="http://www.uwtv.org/programs/displayevent.asp?rid=2459">Google: A Behind-the-Scenes Look</a>. The comparison of what kit you can get for $750,000 is a classic, though I am sure IBM will not think so. Also interesting the approach Google take to performance - throw more hardware at it. Of course, they have an architecture and problem space that allows the work to be spread across lots of machines.

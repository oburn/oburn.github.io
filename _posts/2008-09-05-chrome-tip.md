Like all the other computer people, I have taken the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> browser for a spin. There are certainly some interesting new features in there and it is a great first effort. My favourite is the multi-process model, which I have heard being described <a href="http://feedhouse.mozillazine.org/">as righteous</a>.

<p>
Hence, it is even all the more humorous when you open a couple of tabs and then type the URL `about:%` into the Omnibox. Try it and behold the righteous process architecture at it's finest. :-)

PS: I will not use Google Chrome as a serious browser until it gets <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">this</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722">this</a>. I will not hold my breath, given Google's business model.

<p class="first">Finally I have got around to releasing version 5.0 beta 1 of Checkstyle.
This release is built on Java 5 for Java 5 (and above). There are new
Checks for Java 5 and numerous bug fixes. See more details at
<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/5.x/releasenotes.html">http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/5.x/releasenotes.html</a>.</p>

<p>The source code has been converted over to use Java 5. It has been
interesting to use Java 5 in anger and I have learnt a bit (which was
the motivation). I do like the way <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/">Google Collections</a> helps reduce the
amount of noise that comes from Generics. My favourite Java 5 language
feature to date without a doubt is <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">annotations</a>.</p>

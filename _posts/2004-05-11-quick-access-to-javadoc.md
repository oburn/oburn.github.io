I just saw <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/133.cfm">here</a> that <a href="http://javadocs.org/">javadocs.org</a> has been announced. The tip posted by Sam Pullara works a treat in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>. Highly recommended as a quick was to get at Javadoc.

To try it, paste the following the following URL into your browser:

</p>
<blockquote>
javascript:q=prompt('Java%20Class:','');location.href='http://javadocs.org/'+q;

</blockquote>

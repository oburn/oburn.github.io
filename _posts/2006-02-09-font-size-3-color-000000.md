title: Weekends are for getting ahead

In the IT industry it is very easy to get caught in a trap of working extended hours. Now that is OK from time to time, but not acceptable when it is the norm.

One thing I do to prevent myself and my team from overworking, is to insist that weekly reports are finished by close of business of Friday. That way it is not possible to be tempted to use the weekend to "<i>catch up</i>". All weekends can be used for is to get ahead on the work due next week.

I find this technique has the powerful and beneficial effect that you are forced to time box tasks that will finish by Friday. So when you go home on Friday, you have a feeling of accomplishment.

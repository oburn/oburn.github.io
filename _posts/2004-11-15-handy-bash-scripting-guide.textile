<p>
  I use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">bash</a> a lot, even
  on Windows thanks to <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>. I
  just came across an excellent guide for scripting under bash called
  the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/">Advanced
  Bash-Scripting Guide</a>. It contains loads of useful examples.

<p>
  I must be getting old, but I am finding that I am getting further
  behind <a href="http://www.michaelstudman.com/codegargle/index.do">my</a> <a href="http://www.madbean.com/blog">geek</a> <a href="http://www.opencurly.com/">friends</a>. No longer do I feel
  compelled to have the latest phone, music gadget or computer
  system. For example I use the <i>drunk test</i> when evaluating a new
  phone. This basically comes down to answering <i>"can I afford to lose
  it in the pub?"</i>.

  The other day I came across a blog
  (thanks <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/bcarney">BMC</a>) which
  went against the trend of crapping on about how great Apple products
  are. The guy was actually thinking of switching back to Windows. It
  made me think of why I do not consider moving to the Mac. I came up
  with the following reasons why I prefer the Windows platform:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good bang for buck on hardware/performance.</li>
  <li>Everything is available for it.</li>
  <li>The server software I need runs just fine. IMAP, HTTP, Subversion.</li>
  <li>
    Got Cygwin to allow me to use all the UNIX stuff I want. Command
    line, X Windows, server stuff (like SSHD).
  </li>
  <li>Java works just fine.</li>
  <li>I have to use Windows at work.</li>
</ul>

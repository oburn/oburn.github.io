My daughter Claira turned two on the weekend. She really knew it was a special day as she was pumped all day and was a bundle of joy. For lunch we had a small party to celebrate which she really enjoyed. In particular she loved the party hats and sun-glasses. <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~oburn/gallery_2nd_bday/index.html">Here are the photos</a>.

<p class="first">
So far this year I have read:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Have-Your-Dog-Stuffed/dp/0812974409/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1">Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I've Learned</a> by Alan Alda. Very funny in parts, especially the stuffed dog. :-)

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Companies-Changed-World-Jonathan-Mantle/dp/1847246141/ref=sr_1_1">Companies That Changed the World</a> by by Jonathan Mantle. It was a Christmas present. Best to scan in the bookshop.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Name-Dropping-Incomplete-Kate-Fitzpatrick/dp/0732274680/ref=sr_11_1">Name Dropping: An Incomplete Memoir</a> by Kate Fitzpatrick. The more I read it, the more I did not like her. Give it a miss.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Me-Terri-Irwin/dp/1416954740/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Steve & Me</a> by Terri Irwin. Just an amazing man, well worth reading.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Time-Goodbye-Linwood-Barclay/dp/0553590421/ref=sr_1_1">No Time for Goodbye</a> by Linwood Barclay. A good page turner, but an obvious in the ending.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.dymocks.com.au/search/results.aspx?N=0&amp;Ntk=All&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Nty=1&amp;Ntt=jeremy%20clarkson">Some books</a> by Jeremy Clarkson. Lot's of little stories, so good for ram raiding (pun intended:-).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I am impressed with how many non-technical books I have read this year. For the new project I am working on, I have been glad to be able to dig into my library for the following books:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/020165783X">UML Distilled</a> by Martin Fowler. An essential when brushing up on the finer points of UML diagrams.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321200683/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1234784477&amp;sr=11-1">Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions</a> by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. I bought it ages ago and now it is proving invaluable.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prefactoring-Ken-Pugh/dp/0596008740/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1234784571&amp;sr=1-1">Prefactoring</a> by Ken Pugh. Useful to skim read again to be reminded of things to consider in a green fields implementation. Same goes for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Enterprise-Java-Software-Development/dp/0321130006/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1234784682&amp;sr=1-1">Effective Enterprise Java</a> by Ted Neward.

</li>
</ul>

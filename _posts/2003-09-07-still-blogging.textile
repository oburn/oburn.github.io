<p>
A few people have commented to me that I seem to have stopped blogging. Thanks for the interest. :-)
</p>

<p>I have the intent to continue blogging, but the reasons I have stopped for
a while are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FreeRoller had (has?) some very bad performance problems which made
  updating the blog a real pain in the butt. I wrote one blog (which I
  normally do offline) which I could not post for days. This was very
  annoying.</li>

  <li>I have got a life! I have been so busy between work and social
  activities something had to give, and blogging is pretty low on the
  list. Sure you understand. ;-) </li>
</ul>

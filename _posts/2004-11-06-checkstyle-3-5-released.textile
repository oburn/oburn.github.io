<p>Finally we have put out the 3.5 release of <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>. This is the last scheduled release on the v3 branch, as work is underway
for the next version of Checkstyle (version 4), which will support the
Java 5 syntax. For the brave, an alpha version is already available in
CVS.</p>
